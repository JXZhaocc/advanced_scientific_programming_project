# advanced_scientific_programming_project
For this project I would like to build up a pipline to analyze the results from a machine learning model whcih is built to predict solubility. Here are some funcitons that will be implemented:
- Extract the part of data that the predicitons are considered to be unacceptable and check the percentage. 
- Calculate the ECFP fingerprints with 2048 bits and 3 radius.
- Plot the chemical space of the wrongly and accurately predicted compounds with UMAP to see if there are obvious patterns in the two groups. The UMAP plot is an interactive plot, when pointing to a specific dot, we can see the chemical structure and how far the prediction is away from the trure value.
- The code is wriiten in a jupyter notebook, documents and comments are added so it will be clear and easy to understand.
